        <p>For as far back I can remember, my father <b>Jainulabdeen's</b> day began at 4 a.m. He would be 
           up before anyone else in the household. After saying his prayers in  the breaking light
           of the day, he would go on a long walk to visit his coconut grove. We lived in <b>Rameswaram,</b>
           a small temple town on an island in <b>Tamil Nadu.</b> This being   on the east coast of <b>India, </b>
           dawn would break early, and our day's schedule followed the rhythm of the rising and setting of the sun and the sea waves.<br/>
           The sound of the sea was a constant presence in our lives.Storms and cyclones blew by with regularity during the tumultuous monsoon months .
            We lived in our ancestral home , a fairly large house made of limestone and brick , built some time in the nineteenth century . It was never luxurious ,
          but was filled with love . My father had a boat - building business . Additionally , we also owned a small coconut grove some four miles away from our house . 
          That was where my father would be headed for in the early morning hours . His walking circuit was well established and he rarely deviated from it . 
          First he would step out into Mosque Street , where our house located . It was  a small , predominantly Muslim locality not too far from the Shiva temple that has made our town famous for centuries .
           He would then walk through the narrow lanes of the town , on to the more open roads leading to the coconut groves , and finally wind his way through the groves to his patch of land .<br/> 
           <b>Today</b> I try to imagine him walking on those quiet roads , long before the day made its many demands on him . Ours was a large family and I am sure there were many pressures on him to see to our needs . 
           But at that hour , I think of him listening intently to the sea , to the ever - present ravens and other birds that swooped and flew all around , woken up by the rising sun like him . 
           Perhaps he said his prayers to himself as he walked , or thought of his family with a calm , uncluttered early morning mind . I never did ask him what went through his mind on this long daily walk - for when does a young boy really have the time to reflect in this way about his father ? 
           But I was always sure that the morning walk added something to his personality , an element of calm that was apparent even to strangers .<br/> <b>My father</b> was not a person with much formal education ; 
           neither did he ever acquire much wealth in his long lifetime . Yet , he was one of the wisest , truly generous men I have had the fortune of knowing . Our mosque was the focal point the locality , 
           and my father was the man everyone turned to in  their hour of need . They believed that he was truly connected to God . I remember going to the mosque to say my prayers with him .
         He made sure we never missed any of our prayers and neither did it enter our minds to shirk this duty . After saying our namaz , when we would step out on to the road , groups of people would inevitably be there ,
          waiting to talk to him and share their worries with him .<br/><b> What</b> did these men and women see in him ? He was not a preacher , nor a teacher . He was just a man who lived by his convictions and the tenets of his religion . 
          What did he give them ? I now think that it was his mere presence that calmed them and gave them hope . He said prayers for them , and many people would offer him bowls of water . He would dip his fingertips in them and say a prayer , 
          after which the water would be taken away to be given to the sick . Later , many of these people would come to the house and thank him for having cured their near and dear ones .<br/>
           <b> Why</b> did he do this ? And where did he get the peacefulness and generosity of heart to talk to people , comfort them and the midst of the busyness of his own life ? He was a humble boat owner . 
           Life was certainly not easy for him , what with finding the best ways to make ends meet in a tiny temple town cut off from the mainland . Yet , never once
