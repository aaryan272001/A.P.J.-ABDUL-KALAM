            Many years ago, I wrote a poem called <b>'My Mother'</b>, which began with these lines:
        </p>
        <p>Sea waves, golden sand, pilgrims' faith,<br/>
            Rameswaram mosque Street, all merge into one,<br/>
            My Mother!
        </p>
        <p>
            My growing up years , which I now remember with such nostalgia , are suffused with the memory of <b>Rameswaram</b> , and the two people who were the centre of my world then - my father and mother . 
            Ours was a middle - class family . My father had his own small business besides being the imam of the mosque . My mother , Ashiamma , came from a family , one of whom had some time in the past been given the title of ' Bahadur ' by the British .<br/>
            My mother was a gentle , down - to - earth , pious woman . She was a devout Muslim , like my father , and when I think of her I cannot but remember her saying her namaz five times a day , bending and praying , the look on her face one of extreme devotion and peacefulness . 
            She had a large family to look after and that was where most of her energy went . Our family consisted of my siblings and 1 , as well as our relatives , like grandparents and my uncles , all of who lived in the same house , 
            Providing for everyone was always a stretch on the resources , It was not a time of plenty for anyone , least of all for us . We had a good steady income from my father's businesses - his coconut groves and ferry business but that just about covered our expenses , 
            and there was never any question about indulging in luxuries .<br/>
            In these circumstances , my mother remained the ideal partner for my father . She saved and understood frugality , yet there was never a trace of irritation or anger in her about the way of life that we led . 
            Almost daily , not only were the many members of the family fed and looked after satisfactorily , we usually had umpteen people drop by who would be told to stay back and eat with us . Now that I think about it , I feel that she cooked and served for as many - if not more - guests as there were members of the household . 
            Yet , this was accepted as normal , and no one really remarked on it or thought much about it . Such was the Indian concept of hospitality once upon a time .<br/>
            Mine was a happy , secure childhood . One of my earliest memories is of eating with my mother , sitting on the kitchen floor . We ate off banana leaves . Rice , aromatic sambar , home-made pickles and coconut chutney were the staple foods . Her cooking was deceptively simple and till today , 
            I have not eaten sambar that balances the tart and the spicy tastes as delicately as hers did . It is again in connection with food that another anecdote from my childhood comes to me .<br/>
            During the <b>World War</b> II years , food was being rationed and there was a general shortage of nearly everything . My mother and grandmother did their best to tide over those days , stretching the supplies as much as they could , cutting out any wastage , often reducing the portions on their plates so that the children had enough to eat . 
            One day , my mother had made chapattis instead of rice . I sat at my place on the floor and ate with great relish as she rolled out one fresh chapatti after another . They kept coming and I kept eating . I was a hungry little boy after all . When I had finally had my fill , I picked up my banana leaf plate and walked away to wash up . 
            Later that night , my elder brother took me aside and scolded me for the first time . How could you be so blind , Abdul ? ' he started . At first I had no idea why I was being pulled up . I stared uncomprehendingly at him . Then he softened and explained , ' Did you not notice that there is just enough for all of us to eat two - three chapattis each ? 
            Amma will never say no to you , but because you kept eating , she kept serving you , and tonight she will go hungry.because now there is nothing left for to eat.
