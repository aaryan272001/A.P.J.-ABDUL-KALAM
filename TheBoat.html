            <b>Living</b> on the island of <b>Rameswaram</b> while I was growing up, the sea was an important part of our lives . 
            Its tides , the lapping of the waves , the sound of trains passing on the Pamban Bridge , 
            the birds that always circled the town and the salt in the air are sights and sounds that will always remain linked with my memories of childhood .
            Apart from its sheer presence around us , the sea was also a source of livelihood for our neighbours and us . Almost every household had some connection with the sea , 
            whether as fishermen or as boat owners .<br/>
            My father , too , operated a ferry that took people back and forth between the islands of Rameswaram and Dhanushkodi , which is about twenty - two kilometres away . 
            I still remember the time when he got the idea for this , and how we built that boat .<br/>
            <b>Rameswaram</b> has , since antiquity , been an important pilgrimage destination . Rama is believed to have stopped here and built the bridge to Lanka when he was on his way to rescue Sita . 
            The temple of Rameswaram is dedicated to Shiva , and houses a lingam fashioned by Sita herself . Some versions of the Ramayana say that Rama , Lakshmana and Sita stopped here to pray to Shiva on their way back to Ayodhya from Lanka.<br/>
            People visiting our town would go to Dhanushkodi a of their pilgrimage . A bath at Sagara - Sangam here is considered sacred . The sangam is the meeting place of the Bay of Bengal and the Indian Ocean . 
            Dhanushkodi is now connected by road and vans take pilgrims there , but way back when I was a child . a ferry was also a good way of reaching the island .<br/> 
            My father , looking to supplement his not very substantial income , decided to start a ferry business . He started building the boat that we needed for this himself , on the seashore . <br/>
            Watching the boat come to life from pieces of wood and metal was perhaps my first introduction to the world of engineering . Wood was procured and Ahmed Jalalluddin , a cousin , arrived to help my father out . Every day , 
            I would wait impatiently till I could go to the place where the boat was taking shape . Long pieces of wood were cut into the required shape , dried , smoothened and then joined together . 
            Wood fires seasoned the wood that made up the hull and the bulkheads . Slowly the bottom , then the sides and the hull began to form in front of our eyes . Many years later , in my work , I would learn how to make rockets and missiles . 
            Complex mathematics and scientific research would be the bedrock of those engineering marvels . But that boat coming up on a seashore , which would take pilgrims and fishermen back and forth ... who is to say it was not as important or momentous in our lives then ?<br/>
            The building of the boat was an important influence for me in another way . It brought Ahmed Jalalluddin into my life . He was much older than me , yet we struck up a friendship . He recognized the inherent desire within me to learn and question , 
            and was always there to lend a patient ear and give words of advice . He could read and write English , and spoke to me about scientists and inventions , literature and medicine . Walking with him in the streets of Rameswaram , or by the seaside , or by our boat as it took shape ,
            my mind began to form ideas and ambitions .<br/> 
            <b>The boat</b> business was a great success . My father employed some men to operate it , and groups of pilgrims would use the service to reach Dhanushkodi . There were days when I would slip in among the crowd and sit with the crew as they steered the boat to and from Rameswaram . 
            I heard the story of Rama and how he built the bridge to Lanka with the help of his army of monkeys ; how he brought back Sita and stopped at for Rameswaram again , so that they could perform penance having killed Ravana ; how Hanuman was told to bring back a large lingam from far up north , 
            but when he took too long , Sita would not wait and fashioned a lingam with her own hands to worship Shiva . These stories and many others washed around me in different tongues and shapes , as people from all over India used our ferry service . 
            A little boy among so many was always welcome and there would be someone or the other willing to talk to me , share the story of his life and his reasons for making the pilgrimage .<br/> 
            And so the years went by . My school , teachers , Ahmed Jalalluddin and others taught me so many things . But the boat and the people who sailed in it were no less important . In this way , among the waves and the sands , laughter and stories , the days flew by . Then one day , disaster struck .<br/>
            The Bay of Bengal is hit frequently by cyclones . The months of November and May in particular are dangerous in this regard . I still remember the night of that terrible cyclone vividly . The wind had picked up speed for days , till it became a howling gale . 
            It screamed and whistled in our ears and pulled and hacked at the trees or anything that stood in its way . Soon torrential rain started . We had retreated into our houses much earlier . There was no electricity in those days , and the lamps barely managed to stay alive . 
            In that flickering darkness , with the wind working itself into a frenzy , the sound of the rain lashing down outside , we huddled together and waited for the night to pass . My thoughts travelled again and again to the open seas . 
            Was anyone trapped there ? What was it like to be in a storm such as this without your mother's comforting presence close by ?<br/>
            The next morning , after the storm died down , we saw the unbelievable destruction that had been wrought all around us . Trees , houses , plantations were uprooted and devastated . The roads had disappeared under water and debris flown in by winds that had come in at speeds of over 100 miles an hour . 
            But the worst news of all was the one that hit us like a punch to the stomach . Our boat had been washed away . Now when I think of that day , I realize that perhaps my father had known this would happen the night before , while we waited for the storm to pass . In his life he had already witnessed so many storms and cyclones . 
            This was just one of them . Yet , he had tried to calm us children down and had made sure we went to sleep without infecting us with his worries . In the light of the morning , seeing his drawn face and the worries lining his eyes , I tried to gather my thoughts . In my mind I mourned our lost ferry boat fiercely . 
            It felt as though something I had made with my own hands had been gathered up tossed away thoughtlessly .<br/> 
            <b>Yet</b> , my father's stoicism is what saw us through this crisis too . In time another boat came , and business resumed . Pilgrims and tourists returned . The temple and the mosque filled with worshippers and the markets bustled with men and women , buying and selling once more .
            Cyclones and storms struck us again and again . I even learnt to sleep through them . Many years later , in <b>1964</b> , when I was no longer living in <b>Rameswaram</b> , a massive cyclone struck . This time , it carried away a part of the landmass of Dhanushkodi . 
            A train that was on Pamban Bridge at the time was washed away , with many pilgrims inside . It altered the geography of the area , and Dhanushkodi became a ghost town , never really recovering its former character . Even today , remnants of buildings stand there as monuments to the 1964 cyclone .<br/> 
            My father lost his ferry boat once more in that storm . He had to rebuild his business yet again . I could not do much to help him practically , for I was far removed from that world . But when I struggled to give shape to the Satellite Launch Vehicle ( SLV ) rocket , or the Prithvi and Agni missiles , 
            when countdowns and take - offs were disrupted , and our rocket launch sites situated by the Arabian Sea and Bay of Bengal in Thumba and Chandipur were rained upon , I always remembered the look on my father's face the day after the storm . It was an acknowledgement of the power of nature , 
            of knowing what it means to live by the sea and make your living from it . Of knowing that there is a larger energy and force that can crush our ambitions and plans in the blink of an eye , and that the only way to survive is to face your troubles and rebuild your life .
