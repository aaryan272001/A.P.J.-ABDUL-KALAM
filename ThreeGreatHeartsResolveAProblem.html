            M y childhood town of <b>Rameswaram</b> is a small island . Its highest spot is the top of a hill called <b>Gandamadana Parvatham</b> . Standing there , you could see the whole of <b>Rameswaram</b> stretched out around you - lush green coconut palms swaying everywhere , 
            the sea in the distance and the looming gopuram of the Ramanathaswamy Temple presiding over the skyline . It was a quiet town then . The people made their living from either fishing or coconut farming , and from the tourism that occurred due to the presence of the temple . 
            <b>Rameswaram</b> is one of the holiest pilgrimage spots for Indians , and the town was almost always full of pilgrims and tourists.<br/> 
            The small local population consisted of mostly Hindu households , with a sprinkling of Muslims like us , and Christians too . Each community lived in healthy contentment next to the other . The divisions and vicissitudes of the outside world rarely made their way here . 
            The daily papers brought news of upheavals and communal fault lines being drawn elsewhere , but here , life continued at its age - old leisurely pace.<br/>
            This quiet harmony had been in place for generations . My father loved to tell us the story of our great - great - grandfather , who once saved the idol of the <b>Ramanathaswamy Temple</b> . The story went that on a certain festival day , the vigraha , or idol , would be taken out of the sanctum sanctorum and carried in a procession around the temple precincts . 
            The temple has a number of tanks dotting it , and the idol was taken around the periphery of these tanks too . During one such procession , in a sequence of events no one remembers clearly any more , the vigraha fell into the tank . What a calamity that was ! People stood rooted in horror , imagining the wrath of the gods falling upon them very soon . 
            One person , however , did not lose his presence of mind - my great - great - grandfather . He leapt into the tank and retrieved the idol in no time . The gratitude of the priests and other temple officials was overwhelming . 
            Yes , he was a Muslim . And yes , caste and religious purists would be horrified at the most sacred element of the temple being handled by someone not authorized to do so , but none of these feelings were articulated . 
            Instead , my great - great - grandfather was treated like a hero . The temple also made a proclamation that from now on , at festival , the temple would give Mudal Marayadai to him . This was a rare honour for anyone , let alone for someone from a different religion . It meant that on each such festival day , 
            the temple would first honour , or give <i>marayadai</i> to my great - great grandfather . This tradition went on for years and years and the <i>marayadai</i> would be given to my father too .<br/>
            This sense of harmony continued into later years . Like I have mentioned in another chapter , my father had a ferry business in which pilgrims were taken to Dhanushkodi . Our ferry service was used by the temple too .<br/>
            My father was the imam of the Rameswaram mosque . He was a deeply devout man with complete and utter faith in the Koran . He inculcated all the habits of a good Muslim in his children and indeed in his entire family . For the people of the town , he was a philosopher and guide - someone they could turn to with their problems , whether spiritual or otherwise .<br/>
            One of his closest friends was the priest of the Ramanathaswamy Temple , Pakshi Lakshmana Sastry . Sastrygal was not only the priest but also a very learned man , well versed in Vedic knowledge . I still remember his visage perfectly . He was always dressed in the traditional attire of a temple priest , in his dhoti and angavastram . On his head he sported the mandatory tuft of the Brahmins , the kudumi . He was one of the kindest , most gentle men I knew .
