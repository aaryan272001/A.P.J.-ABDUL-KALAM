            Every morning a large pile of newspapers, both in English and Tamil, is delivered to me.
            <b>During</b> my travels abroad I like to stay in touch with news from <b>India</b> , which I do by going online to read news articles and editorials in different <b>magazines</b> and <b>papers</b> . 
            The wealth of information now available at the click of a finger amazes me . As a person closely involved with <b>engineering</b> and <b>science</b> , 
            the march of technology should not surprise me , but when I juxtapose our lives today with what it was like seventy years ago , in a small south Indian town , the difference is startling even for me .<br/>
            I was born in the year <b>1931</b>. When I was about eight , World War II broke out . Britain declared war on Nazi Germany , and despite the Indian Congress's opposition , India too , as a British colony , was involved in the war . 
            <b>India's</b> war effort saw a record number of Indian soldiers being deployed in various warzones around the <b>world</b> . Daily life , however , remained fairly unaffected initially , particularly for us in the southern tip of the country .<br/> 
            As I have mentioned , <b>Rameswaram</b> in the 1940s was a sleepy little town that came alive with the arrival of pilgrims . The  inhabitants were mostly tradespeople or small businessmen . The town was dominated by the temple , though there was a mosque and a church too .
            The inhabitants went about their way fairly peacefully , and other than the normal altercations that break in any town or village , nothing much of importance happened . <br/>
            The only source of information about the outside world was the newspaper . The agency that distributed newspapers was run by my cousin <b>Samsuddin</b> . Along with <b>Jalalluddin</b> , he was a big influence in my early life . 
            Though he could read and write , Samsuddin was not well travelled nor highly educated . Yet he had such affection for me and encouraged me in so many ways , that he became a guiding light for me . These men understood my deepest thoughts and feelings before I could articulate them . 
            To me they were adults who could reach out beyond the narrow confines of their daily lives and businesses and see the larger world .<br/>
            <b> Samsuddin's</b> newspaper distribution agency was the only one in <b>Rameswaram</b> . There were about a thousand literate people in the town , and he delivered newspapers to all of them . The papers carried news about the Independence Movement that was heading towards a crescendo at the time . 
            These news items would be read and discussed with great gusto among everyone . There would also be news from the war front , about <b>Hitler</b> and the <b>Nazi army</b> . Of course , there were many mundane matters too , like <b>astrological references or bullion rates</b> , which were consulted with utmost interest . 
            The Tamil paper <b><i>Dinamani</i></b> was the most popular of all these papers .<br/>
            The way the papers reached <b>Rameswaram</b> was quite unique . They came by morning train and were kept at <b>Rameswaram</b> station . From there they had to be collected and sent to all the subscribers . 
            This was Samsuddin's business and he managed it effortlessly . However , as <b>World</b> War II raged , we no longer remained isolated from the world , and it affected my life and the newspaper delivery business in a strange new way .<br/>
            <b>The British government</b> had placed a number of sanctions and rations on goods . Something like a state of emergency now prevailed in the country . Our large family felt the difficulties acutely .<b> Food , clothes ,</b> the needs of the babies of the household , all became difficult to procure and provide for . 
            In our family there were five sons and daughters , as well as my father's brothers ' families . My grandmother and mother had to stretch every resource to the utmost to keep everyone fed , clothed and in good health .<br/>
